![Habbo Idle Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroResources/Habbo-Anti-AFK/master/images/sleeping-icon.png "Habbo Idle Icon") This useful resource will allow you to avoid going Idle without the need for [Habbo WIRED][1] or an [AFK Booster][2].

This allows you to gain in-game virtual currency such as [Credits][3], [Diamonds][4] and [Duckets][5] that you wouldn't get when away from keyboard ("AFK").

> *Heads up: I recommend you check with the Hotel Rules and Guidelines ("The Habbo Way") to make sure they allow anti-afk methods of boosting to avoid being warned, reset or banned.*


## AutoHotKey.

We will be using [AutoHotkey][6]. It's a free, open-source scripting language for [Microsoft Windows][7] that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks - including Habbo and [Retro Hotels][8].


## Setup.

1. Download the latest version of [AutoHotkey v1][9] and follow the installation wizzard.
2. Download the latest version of [antiafk.ahk][10] from our GitHub repository.
3. Once downloaded navigate to your Downloads folder and double click the "**antiafk**" file you just downloaded.
4. Follow the on-screen message to learn how to use the script and get started!


## Habbo Sleeping

When a Habbo goes away from keyboard ("AFK") their habbo will become "Idle" as shown below:
